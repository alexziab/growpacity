``growpacity`` documentation
======================================

``growpacity`` is a Python package that computes Rosseland and Planck mean opacities
for various distributions of grain sizes, using the `OpTool <https://github.com/cdominik/OpTool>`_ code
by `Dominik et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...654A..62D/abstract>`_.
It is designed to be easily integrated into dust growth models, such as `DustPy <https://github.com/stammler/dustpy>`_
